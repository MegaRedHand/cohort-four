# Paul-Henry Kajfasz's Notes

## Context:

Hey ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! I'm Paul-Henry Kajfasz.

Proud fellow, I consider the Ethereum Protocol Fellowship (EPF4) as an incredible opportunity to deep dive into Ethereum, something I have been eagerly waiting for quite some time now. As a result, I have decided to step down from my position as the team lead for the [Beerus Starknet Light client](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/beerus) to fully focus on the EPF. Over the next few months, I will be dedicating myself entirely to protocol development and contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem.

## The Big Jump:

During this period, my primary focus will be on building a new consensus client for Ethereum using the Elixir programming language, in collaboration with the Lambdaclass team. This project will be fully open source and permissionless, aligning with the ethos of the Ethereum ecosystem. After quitting my job, I embarked on a spontaneous journey, hopping on a plane with only 48 hours' notice, to work with the Lambdaclass team in Barcelona. Now, for the next 4 months, I am committed to turning this ambitious goal into a reality.

See you on the other side ðŸŒŒ
